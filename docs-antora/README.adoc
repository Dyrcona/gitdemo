= Antora Docs build procedure

:idseparator: -

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git://git.evergreen-ils.org/Evergreen.git
$ cd Evergreen
$ git checkout LP1848524_antora_ize_docs
----

First we have to install antora:
Summarized from 
https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/install/install-antora/

[source,bash]
----
$ cd docs-antora
# (we want to install into directory as opposed to globally)
$ npm i @antora/cli@2.1 @antora/site-generator-default@2.1
----


Now, install the ui pre-reqs building
lifted from:
https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/set-up-project/

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ui
$ npm install
$ gulp --tasks-simple
$ gulp bundle
----

At this point you should find a file in:

NOTE: build/ui-bundle.zip

Now you can build the website. But you may want to edit the file:

NOTE: docs-antora/site.yml

Because the output folder for the website is defaulted to 

NOTE: /var/www/html/prod

And the default web URL is:

NOTE: http://localhost/prod

Build:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ..
antora site.yml
----

If all went well - then you will have the site built in the output folder that was configured in site.yml!
