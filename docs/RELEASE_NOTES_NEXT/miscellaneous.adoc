  hold stalling. 'Pickup Library Soft stalling interval', when set for,

  smaller than the specified interval only items scanned at the pickup
  library can be opportunistically captured. Example "5 days". This setting
  takes precedence over "Soft stalling interval" (circ.hold_stalling.soft)
  when the interval is in force. 'Pickup Library Hard stalling interval',
  when set for the pickup library, specifies that no items with a
  calculated proximity greater than 0 from the pickup library can be
  directly targeted for this time period if there are local available
  copies.

  includes 'Total Circ Count' and 'Last Circ Date' columns.
