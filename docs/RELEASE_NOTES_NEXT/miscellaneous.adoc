  action to allow users to control which actions are displayed

* Add a new pair of library settings to support pickup library-based
  hold stalling. 'Pickup Library Soft stalling interval', when set for,
  the pickup library, specifies that for holds with a request time age
  smaller than the specified interval only items scanned at the pickup
  library can be opportunistically captured. Example "5 days". This setting
  takes precedence over "Soft stalling interval" (circ.hold_stalling.soft)
  when the interval is in force. 'Pickup Library Hard stalling interval',
  when set for the pickup library, specifies that no items with a
  calculated proximity greater than 0 from the pickup library can be
  directly targeted for this time period if there are local available
  copies.
* New database rules now protect bre.id -1, acn.id -1 and acl.id 1 from editing.

  details page now include 'Total Circ Count' and 'Last Circ Date' columns.
* There is a new library setting, 'Staff Catalog Search Filters', that can be
  used to customize the list of search filters that are available on the
  Angular staff catalog advanced search form. This setting takes an array
  of desired filters, e.g., `["item_lang","audience","lit_form"]`. The complete
  list of available filters is item_type, item_form, item_lang, audience,
  vr_format, bib_level, and lit_form. If the library setting is not set,
  all of the filters are displayed.
* The Bootstrap public catalog now displays cover images on the My Account
  items checked out, check out history, holds, and holds history pages.
* Funding sources now have an active flag. If a funding source is marked
  as inactive, adding credits to it or allocating from it is disabled, and
  it will not show up in the list of possible funding sources when allocating
  to a fund.
