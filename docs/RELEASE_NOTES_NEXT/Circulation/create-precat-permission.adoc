New Permission: CREATE_PRECAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This permission is required to create (or re-create) a pre-cataloged item
through the "Barcode ??? was mis-scanned or is a non-cataloged item."
dialog.  All form elements in the pre-cat dialog other than the Cancel
button will be disabled if the current user lacks the CREATE_PRECAT
permission when an uncataloged (or already pre-cataloged item) is scanned.
This permission is not needed to renew pre-cataloged items.

The upgrade script for this feature will insert the permission into every
permission group that has the STAFF_LOGIN permission, so out-of-the-box no
behavior will change.
