== Courses can be un-archived ==

Course reserves staff can now un-archive a course that was previously archived, either from
its course page, or from the course list.

Un-archiving a course makes it active again.  Users with public roles in the course (such
as instructors) remain associated with the course.  Non-public users (such as students)
are removed.
