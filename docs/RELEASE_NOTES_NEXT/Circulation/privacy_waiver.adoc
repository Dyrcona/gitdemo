Allow Others to Use My Account (Privacy Waiver)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patrons who wish to authorize other people to use their account may
now do so via My Account.  In the Search and History Preferences tab
under Account Preferences, a new section labeled "Allow others to use
my account" allows patrons to enter a name and indicate that the
specified person is allowed to place holds, pickup holds, view
borrowing history, or check out items on their account.  This
information is displayed to circulation staff in the patron account
summary in the web client.  (Staff may also add, edit, and remove
entries via the patron editor.)

A new library setting, "Allow others to use patron account (privacy
waiver)," is used to enable or disable this feature.
