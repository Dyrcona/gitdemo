Hold Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature allows staff to add multiple users to a named hold group
bucket and place title-level holds for a record for that entire set of users.
Users can be added to such a hold group bucket from either the patron
search result interface, via the Add to Bucket dropdown, or through a dedicated
Hold Group interface available from the Circulation menu.  Adding new
patrons to a hold group bucket will require staff have the PLACE_HOLD
permission.

Holds can be placed for the users in a hold group bucket either directly from
the normal staff-place hold interface in the embedded OPAC, or by supplying the
record ID within the hold group bucket interface.  In the latter case, the
list of users for which a hold was attempted but failed to be placed can be
downloaded by staff in order to address any placement issues.  Placing a
hold group bucket hold will requires staff have the MANAGE_HOLD_GROUPS
permission, which is new with this development.

In the event of a mistaken hold group hold, staff with the MANAGE_HOLD_GROUPS
permission will have the ability to cancel all unfulfilled holds created as
part of a hold group event.

A link to the title's hold interface is available from the list of hold group
events in the dedicated hold group interface.
