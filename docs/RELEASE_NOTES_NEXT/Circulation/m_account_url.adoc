== Template Support for Information and My Account URLs ==

A new setting has been added named lib.my_account_url to provide a path usable in templates to a patron's account login.  Both this and the existing lib.info_url settings are now available in the server side processed templates, action triggers and traditional print receipts.

Web side processed templates in 3.6 can be found in Administration -> Server Administration -> Print Templates.  
You can add settings using the following syntax:
<div>[% helpers.get_org_setting(staff_org.id, 'lib.info_url'); %]</div>
<div>[% helpers.get_org_setting(staff_org.id, 'lib.my_account_url'); %]</div>

Print Receipts found in Administration -> Workstation -> Print Templates can be added with these includes:
{{includes.info_url}}
{{includes.my_account_url}}

Action triggers can use both values with the helpers.get_org_setting include.  Example:
[% helpers.get_org_setting(circ_lib.id, 'lib.my_account_url') %]
