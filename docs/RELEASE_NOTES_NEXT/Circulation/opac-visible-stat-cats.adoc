== OPAC-visible statisitical categories are now visible in the OPAC ==

This release restores a previously available feature: the ability to 
display statistical categories (stat cats) in the OPAC.  If an
item stat cat has "OPAC Visibility" set to true, its values will
display in the record page's item table, underneath the call number.
If a patron stat cat has "OPAC Visibility" set to true, its values
will display in the patron's account under Preferences ->
Personal Information (below the account expiration date).

Since these values have not been visible for some time, Evergreen
libraries may wish to review them before making them public.  To
set all stat cats to private, so that OPAC visibility can be
restored on a case-by-case basis after review, you can use the
following SQL:

[,sql]
----
-- Item stat cats
UPDATE asset.stat_cat SET opac_visible=false WHERE opac_visible=true;

-- Patron stat cats
UPDATE actor.stat_cat SET opac_visible=false WHERE opac_visible=true;
----
