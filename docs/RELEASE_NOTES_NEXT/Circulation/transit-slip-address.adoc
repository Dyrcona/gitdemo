== Source library addresses now available on transit slips ==

Transit slip templates previously could include the address of
the library that the item is being transitted _to_.  With this
release, the address of the library the item is being transitted
_from_ is also available.
This change applies to both the Hold Transit Slip and the Transit
Slip templates.
