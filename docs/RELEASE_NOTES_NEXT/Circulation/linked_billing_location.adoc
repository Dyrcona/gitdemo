Library Links in Billing Details screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Billing Full Details view now includes links to information about the billing and owning
libraries. This can be useful in situations where circulation staff are troubleshooting a
bill and would like to quickly find contact information for the billing or owning library.
