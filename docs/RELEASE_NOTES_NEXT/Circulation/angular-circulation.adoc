== Experimental Angular Circulation Interfaces ==

This Evergreen release includes new, experimental versions of many
circulation interfaces.  To enable these interfaces:

. In the Library Settings Editor, enable the setting called
_Enable Angular Circulation Menu_.
. Add the _ACCESS_ANGULAR_CIRC_ permission to any users who
will be testing the experimental interfaces.

These interfaces are experimental, and should not be used for production
work.  Please report any issues with the interfaces at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen
