Allow Circulation Renewal for Expired Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The "Allow renewal request if renewal recipient privileges have
expired" organizational unit setting can be set to true to permit
expired patrons to renew circulations.  Allowing renewals for expired
patrons reduces the number of auto-renewal failures and assumes that a
patron with items out eligible for renewals has not been expired for
very long and that such patrons are likely to renew their privileges
in a timely manner.

The setting is referenced based on the current circulation library for
the renewal.  It takes into account the global flags for "Circ: Use
original circulation library on desk renewal instead of the
workstation library" and "Circ: Use original circulation library on
opac renewal instead of user home library."
