Update Hold Notification Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The public catalog and staff client now have the ability to update existing
holds if a patron or a staff member changes certain notification preferences or
contact information.  Evergreen will detect these changes and prompt the staff
user or patron user and ask if they want to update existing holds with the new
contact information and/or notification preferences.
