Option to Limit Hold Items to Available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new option has been added to the SIP2 implementation configuration,
`msg64_hold_items_available`.  When set, this option will limit the
count and list of hold items in the SIP2 patron information response
message (64) to only those holds that are available for pickup.  When
not set, the full list of the patron's holds will continue to be sent.
This option is useful because some self checks expect to receive only
the list of available holds in the hold items and have few settings to
control the display of holds.
