Fine Item Detail Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SIP now suppports enhancements for the Fine Item Detail returned by by Patron Information
Response (code 64).  Different manufacturers of self-check systems specify the format
of the fine item detail differently.  A new option allows you to select the format to
return.

Configuration
+++++++++++++
After installation of Evergreen and SIP, in the Evergreen configuration directory (typically
/openils/conf) the SIP configuration file oils_sip.xml awaits your modifications to use this
feature.

In the <implementation_config><options> section, you can place an option of the form +
        `<option name='av_format' value='`__<value>__`'>` +
where __<value>__ is one of thsee values:

* `3m`
* `eg_legacy`
* `swyer_a`
* `swyer_b`

If you omit the option, the default will act as though you wrote +
        `<option name='av_format' value='eg_legacy'>`

Currently, the behaviour of `eg_legacy` is close to, but not precisely that of `3m`.  The
`eg_legacy` produces the pre-enhancement behavior in Evergreen.   Currently, the
`swyer_a` behavior
is identical to that of `3m`, but there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.

If you change the brand of your self-check equipment, you may need to change the value
of the option to be consistent with the new brand.
