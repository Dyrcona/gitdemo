Configurable Read More Accordion for OPAC Search and Record View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read More Button
++++++++++++++++
OPAC record Fields now truncate themselves based on a configurable amount of characters.
The full field may be displayed upon hitting a (Read More) link, which will then toggle
into a (Read Less) link to re-truncate the field.

Configuration
+++++++++++++
Open-ILS/src/templates/opac/parts/config.tt2 Contains two new configuration variables:
truncate_contents(default: 1) and contents_truncate_length(default: 50). Setting
truncate_contents to 0 will disable the read more functionality.
The variable contents_truncate_length corresponds to the amount of characters to display
before truncating the text. If contents_truncate_length is removed, it will default to 100.
Additional configuration for note fields can be made in
Open-ILS/src/templates/opac/parts/record/contents.tt2, allowing a trunc_length variable for
each individual type of note, which will override contents_truncate_length for that specific
type of note.


Adding Read More Functionality to further fields
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To add Read More functionality to any additional fields, you may use the macro
accordion(), defined in misc_util.tt2. It can take three variables: str,
trunc_length, and element. str corresponds to the string you want to apply it to,
trunc_length(optional) will override contents_truncate_length if supplied, and
element(optional) provides an alternative HTML element to look at for the truncation
process(useful in situations such as the Authors and Cast fields, where each field is
processed individually, but needs to be treated as a single field).
