View upcoming booking reservations in the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new tab in the My Account section of the OPAC shows
patrons information about reservations on their account.
Here, patrons can check on upcoming reservations, as 
well as reservations they currently have checked out.

Note: this interface pulls its timezone from the Library
Settings Editor.  Make sure that you have a timezone
listed for your library in the Library Settings Editor
before using this feature.
