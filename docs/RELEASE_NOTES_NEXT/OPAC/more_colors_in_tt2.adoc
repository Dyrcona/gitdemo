Easier TPAC Customization via colors.tt2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Twelve new colors for TPAC have been added to the colors.tt2 file as well as 
having coresponding changes to the style.css.tt2 file. These use 
descriptive rather than abstract names. These changes help avoid 
situations were unreadable values are placed on top of each other 
and where different values are wanted for elements that only refernece 
a single color previously. Guidelines are below for setting values that 
correspond to the previous values used in the colors.tt2 file.  
For more diverse customizations the OPAC should be reviewed before 
a production load.

* 'footer' is used for the background color of the footer. It replaces the 
'primary'.
* 'footer_text' sets the text color in the footer and replaces 'text_invert' 
* 'header' sets the background of the header and replaces 'primary_fade'
* 'header_text' sets the color of text in the header and replaces 'text_invert'
* 'header_links_bar' sets the background of the links bar that separates the 
header on the front page of the opac and replaces 'background_invert'
* 'header_links_text' sets the text on the links bar and replaces 'text_invert'
* 'header_links_text_hover' set the hover text color on the links bar and 
replaces 'primary'
* 'opac_button' sets the background color of the My Opac button and replaces 
'control'
* 'opac_button_text' explicitly sets the text color on the My Opac button  
* 'opac_button_hover' sets the background color of the My Opac button when the 
mouse is hovering over it and replaces 'primary'
* 'opac_button_hover_text' sets the text color of the My Opac button when the 
mouse is hovering over it and replaces 'text invert'

Note that is patch is primarily meant for users who wish to continue
using TPAC rather than the Bootstrap skin for a while; new Evergreen
users are advised to use the now-default Bootstrap skin.
