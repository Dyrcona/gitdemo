== Additional trailing punctuation removed from certain fields ==

MarcXML facet, display, and browse fields will undergo some extra
cleanup before displaying to a user.  Of particular note for any
title fields that match these criteria, ending `/`, `:`, `;`, and
`=` will be removed.

This change does not affect MODS fields.  You can check if a
particular field uses MarcXML or MODS in Server Administration
-> MARC Search/Facet Fields by consulting the Format column.
