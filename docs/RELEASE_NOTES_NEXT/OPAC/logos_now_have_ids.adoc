Evergreen now has IDs associated with logos and cart images in the TPAC and Bootstrap OPACs to aid in customization.  Images are as follows:

* small Evergreen logo in navigation bar is 'topnav_logo_image'
* the large Evergreen logo in the center of the splash page of the TPAC is 'homesearch_main_logo_image' 
* the cart icon is 'cart_icon_image' 
* the small logo in the footer is 'footer_logo_image'

The Bootstrap OPAC does not have a homesearch logo icon as it is added in the background by CSS and can be directly styled through the CSS.
