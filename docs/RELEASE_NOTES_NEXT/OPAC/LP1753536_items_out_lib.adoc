New Column in Items Out Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new column, Owning Library, is now optionally available for the OPAC
Items Out display which shows the owning library of the item (not
necessarily the library at which the item was picked up).  Clicking on
the library name will provide contact information for that library.
This is useful for When a patron has run out of renewals and the
owning library, not the patron's home library, is the one with whom
the patron will negotiate additional renewals.  If the patron will
negotiate additional renewals with their home library or the checkout
library, then display of this field is superfluous.

The display of this column is controlled by the organization setting
"opac.show_owning_library_column."
