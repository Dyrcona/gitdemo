New Column in Items Out Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new column, Owning Library, is now optionally available for the Items 
Out display which shows the owning library of the item (not necessarily 
the library at which the item was picked up).  When a patron has run
 out of renewals, the owning library is the one with whom the patron 
will negotiate additional renewals, and clicking on the library 
name will provide contact information for that library.

The column is controlled by the organization setting 
"opac.show_owning_library_column".
