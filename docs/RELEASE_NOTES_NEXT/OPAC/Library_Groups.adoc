Library Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Library Groups search feature revives a longstanding internal
concept in Evergreen called “Lassos,” which allows an administrator
to define a group of organizational units for searching outside of
the standard organizational unit hierarchy.

Use case examples include creating a group of law or science
libraries within a university consortium, or grouping all school
libraries together within a mixed school/public library.

Searches can be restricted to a particular Library Group from the
library selector in the public catalog basic search page and from
the new "Where" selector on the advanced search page.

Restricting catalog searches by Library Group is available only
in the public catalog and "traditional" staff catalog; it is not
available in the Angular staff catalog.

This feature adds a new permission, `ADMIN_LIBRARY_GROUPS`, that
allows updating Library Groups and Library Group Maps. This permission
is not associated with any profiles by default, and replaces
the `CREATE_LASSO`, `UPDATE_LASSO`, and `DELETE_LASSO` permissions. 

To define new library groups, use the Server Administration Library
Groups and Library Group Maps pages. An autogen and a reload of
Apache should be performed after making changes to Library Groups.
