Did You Mean? Single word search suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature is the first in the series to add native search suggestions
to the Evergreen search logic.  A significant portion of the code is
dedicated to infrastructure that will be used in later enhancements to
the functionality.

Overview
++++++++
When searching the public or staff catalog in a single search class (title,
author, subject, series, identifier, or keyword) with a single search term
users can be presented with alternate search terms.  Depending on how the
instance has been configured, suggestions may be provided for only
misspelled words (as defined by existence in the bibliographic corpus),
terms that are spelled properly but occur very few times, or on every
single-term search.

Upgrading
+++++++++++++++++++
This feature requires the addition of new Perl module dependencies.  Please
run the app server and database server dependency Makefiles before applying
the database and code updates.

At the end of the database upgrade script, the administrator is presented
with a set of instructions necessary to precompute the suggestion
dictionary based on the current bibliographic database.  The first half
of this procedure can be started even before the upgrade begins, as soon
as the Evergreen database is no longer accessible to users that might
cause changes to bibliographic records.  For very large instances, this
dictionary generation can take several hours and needs to be run on a
server with significant RAM and CPU resources. Please look at the upgrade
script before beginning an upgrade and plan this dictionary creation as
part of the overall upgrade procedure.

Given a server, such as a database server with 64G of RAM, you should
be able to run all six of the shell commands in parallel in screen
sessions or with a tool such as GNU parallel.

These commands invoke a script that will generate a class-specific sub-
set of the dictionary, and can be used to recreate the dictionary if
necessary in the future.
