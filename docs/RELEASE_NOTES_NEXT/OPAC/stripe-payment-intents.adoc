===== Credit card payments using Stripe now implimented with PaymentIntents instead of Charges =====

This changes the Stripe code in the OPAC to use their PaymentIntents and confirmCreditCard API,
which is recommended over their Charges API.  Credit card charges are no longer finalized
(captured/confirmed) on Evergreen's backend, though the backend does check whether a payment was
made successfully before recording it.
