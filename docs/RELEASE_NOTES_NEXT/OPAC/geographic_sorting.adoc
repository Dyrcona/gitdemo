Sort Holdings by Geographical Proximity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This functionality integrates 3rd party geographic lookup services to allow patrons
to enter an address on the record details page in the OPAC and sort the holdings
for that record based on proximity of their circulating libraries to the entered
address. To support this, latitude and longitude coordinates may be associated with
each org unit. Care is given to not log or leak patron provided addresses or the
context in which they are used.

Requires the following Perl modules: Geo::Coder::Free, Geo::Coder::Google, and Geo::Coder::OSM
