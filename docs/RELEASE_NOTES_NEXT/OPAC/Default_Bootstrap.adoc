Default Public Catalog to the Bootstrap Skin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The public catalog now defaults to the Bootstrap skin rather than the
legacy TPAC skin.

Bootstrap is now the default in order to encourage more testing, but
users should be aware of the following 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bugs?field.tag=bootstrap-blocker[issues];
certain specific functionality is available only in the TPAC skin.

The TPAC skin remains available for use, but current Evergreen users
should start actively considering migrating to the Bootstrap skin.

In order to continue to use the TPAC skin, comment out the following
line in `eg_vhost.conf`

[source,conf]

PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "@localstatedir@/templates-bootstrap" # Comment this line out to use the legacy TPAC
