== (Developer-focused) Use ESLint for eg2 ==

The `eg2` Angular application now uses ESLint rather than TSLint for
source code linting. This is motivated by the deprecation of TSLint
by the Angular CLI, but ESLint also offer some improvements.

In particular, ESLint checks the HTML templates in addition to the
TypeScript code. For example, it will catch uses of `==` in the
templates when `===` is preferred.

The primary ESLint rules applied to the project are configured in
`Open-ILS/src/eg2/.eslintrc.json`. To override them for specific
directories, `.eslintrc` files can be used. An example of this
is `Open-ILS/src/eg2/src/app/share/.eslintrc`, which turns off
the `angular-eslint/no-output-on-prefix` check that discourages
using `onFoo` as the name of `@Output()` properties. This rule
is now enforced in most of `eg2`, but it was decided not to immediately
mandate for shared components.

The command to run the lint checks remains the same: from
`Open-ILS/src/eg2/`, run `ng lint`.
