Angular Grid Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Grids in new Angular staff interfaces now have options to

* allow users to filter results per-column
* make the grid header in tall/long grids sticky (i.e., the
  grid header continues to be displayed while the user
  scrolls through the grid
* allow users to edit a record in a grid and save the results
  without losing one's place in grid paging.
