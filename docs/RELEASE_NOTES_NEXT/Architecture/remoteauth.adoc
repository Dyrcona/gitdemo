Configurable APIs for Patron Authentication and Retrieval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many external services need to authenticate patrons and retrieve information
about their accounts from Evergreen.  Most of these services support some form
of HTTP-based authentication, but every service has its own requirements and
none of them support native Evergreen authentication.  Meanwhile, libraries
often need to restrict access to these external services based on patron type,
current status, standing penalties, and so on.

To meet these needs, Evergreen now has support for separate, configurable HTTP
API endpoints for remote patron authentication and retrieval.  Each RemoteAuth
endpoint handles a different external service or authentication method.  You
set up the endpoints you want in your Apache config; each one uses a generic
mod_perl handler to manage incoming requests, and specifies a Perl module that
can actually talk to the external service, as well as an authentication profile
that determines which patrons can be authenticated at this endpoint.  Support
for https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617["Basic" HTTP Authentication] is
provided as a reference implementation.
