Removal of Custom Dojo Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen had a
https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=scratchpad:random_magic_spells#custom_dojo_build[method
of making a custom build of the Dojo JavaScript library].  Followiing
this procedure could improve the load times for the OPAC and other
interfaces that use Dojo.  However, very few sites took advantage of
this process or even knew of its existence.

As a part of the process, an `openils_dojo.js` file was built and
installed along with the other Dojo files.  Evergreen had many
references to load this optional file.  For the majority of sites that
did not use this custom Dojo process, this file did not exist.
Browsers would spend time and resources requesting this nonexistent
file.  This situation also contributed noise to the Apache logs with
the 404 errors from these requests.

In keeping with the goal of eliminating Dojo from Evergreen, all
references to `openils_dojo.js` have been removed from the OPAC and
other files.  The profile script required to make the custom Dojo
build has also been removed.
