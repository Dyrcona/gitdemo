== Further Angularization of Acquisitions Interfaces ==

The following acquisitions interfaces were rewritten in Angular:

 * Purchase Orders and Selection Lists
 * Line Item management, including
   ** Receiving and claiming
   ** Creation of line item items singly and in batch
 * Load MARC Order Records

Improvements over the previous interfaces include:

 * The line item table can now be sorted and filtered
 * New settings to control the owning library that is
   applied to auto-created line item items.
