== Inactive funds can no longer make allocations or transfers ==

In the Funds Administration page, if a fund is not marked as
active, the "Create allocation" and "Transfer money" options
will no longer be available.

In the occassional cases where these operations are necessary,
you can edit the fund to mark it active, perform your financial
operations, then mark it inactive again.
