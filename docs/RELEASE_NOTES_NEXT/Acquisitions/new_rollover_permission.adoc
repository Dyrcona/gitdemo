== New Permission for Fund Rollovers ==

A new permission, `ADMIN_FUND_ROLLOVER`, is added to control access
to the fund rollover function. This allows having some users be able
to manage funds without being to invoke the rollover action, as
rollovers can be hard to undo.

During upgrade, any permission group with the `ADMIN_FUND` permission
will get the new `ADMIN_FUND_ROLLOVER` permission to avoid surprises.
Consequently, an Evergreen administrator who wishes to lock down
access to the feature should follow up by removing the new permission
where necessary.

In new databases, `ADMIN_FUND_ROLLOVER` is granted only to the stock
Acquisitions Administrators permission group.
