== Support for Advanced Shipment Notices in Acquisitions ==

This version of Evergreen supports DESADV EDI messages.  These messages are
created by vendors when they pack and ship items, and contain:

* A list of dispatched POs, lineitems, and the number of items per lineitem.
* A package-level barcode (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_shipping_container_code) that represents the package as a whole.

Staff can scan that package-level barcode to retrieve information on every
item in the package, including an option to auto-receive every item in the box.
