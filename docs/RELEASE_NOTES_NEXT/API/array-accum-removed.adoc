== array_accum Aggregate Removed ==

The custom `array_accum` aggregate function has been removed from the
PostgreSQL database because it will need to be dropped and recreated
with a different definition when upgrading to PostgreSQL version 14 or
later.  Its functionality is also redundant with PostgreSQL's own
`array_agg` function.

Sites that have custom code using Evergreen's `array_accum` function
should alter their code to use `array_agg` instead.
