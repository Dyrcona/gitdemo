New Options for Importing Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two new options for importing holdings have been added to MARC Batch
Import/Export:

. **Auto-overlay On-order Cataloguing Copies**: This is similar to
  "Auto-overlay In-process Acquisitions Copies," but for copies that were not
  created from an acquisitions workflow.  Holdings information in the incoming
  record will be used to overlay any existing On Order copies for the matching
  record which belong to the owning library defined in the Holdings Import
  Profile.  The Holdings Import Profile is also used to match incoming to
  existing copies, if possible; otherwise, On Order copies are overlaid in the
  order they were created.  The call number will also be overlaid if the
  incoming record provides one.
. **Use Org Unit Matching in Copy to Determine Best Match**: When there are
  multiple potential matching records, this feature allows the user to
  automatically select the record which has the most copies at libraries near
  the importing library in the org tree.  That is, starting at the importing
  library, it climbs the org tree, gradually expanding the scope at which it
  checks for holdings on matching records; once holdings are found, the record
  with the most holdings at that scope is selected for overlay.  If there are
  no matching records with holdings, then the default best match overlay is
  attempted.
