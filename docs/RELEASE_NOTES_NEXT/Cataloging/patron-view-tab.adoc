Patron View tab in Experimental Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The record view screen in the Experimental Catalog now has a 
_Patron View_ tab.  This tab displays a view of the record in
the OPAC, as a patron would see it.

The _Patron View_ tab replaces the previous _View in Catalog_
button.
