Enhanced Request Items Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Request Items action available in the Item Status and Item Buckets
interfaces has been given an Honor User Preferences checkbox which does
the following for the selected user when checked:

 * Change the Pickup Lib selection to match the user's Default Hold Pickup Location
 * Honor the user's Holds Notices settings (including Default Phone Number, etc.)

Success and Failure toasts have also been added based on what happens
after the Request Items interface has closed.

Also, a Title Hold option has been added to the Hold Type menu.  This will create
one hold request for each unique title associated with the items that were selected
when Request Items was invoked.
