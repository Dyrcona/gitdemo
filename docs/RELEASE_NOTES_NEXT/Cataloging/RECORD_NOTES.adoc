== Record Notes ==

Bibliographic record notes can now be edited from the Record Notes tab.  Three new permissions manage this and should be added to cataloging accounts and permission groups as appropriate - CREATE_RECORD_NOTE, UPDATE_RECORD_NOTE and DELETE_RECORD_NOTE. There is an optional public display flag that is not yet supported in the OPAC but included to support future functionality.
