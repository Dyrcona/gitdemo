== Bibliographic Record Notes ==

Bibliographic record notes (i.e., administrative notes stored in the
`biblio.record_note` table, not 5XX fields in the MARC record) can now
be edited from the Record Notes tab.  Three new permissions manage this
and should be added to cataloging accounts and permission groups as
appropriate:  `CREATE_RECORD_NOTE`, `UPDATE_RECORD_NOTE`, and
`DELETE_RECORD_NOTE`. There is an optional public display flag that is
not yet supported in the OPAC but included to support future functionality.
