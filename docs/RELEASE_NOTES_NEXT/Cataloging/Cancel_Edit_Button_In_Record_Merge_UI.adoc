New Cancel Edit Button In Record Merge Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The web staff client's Record Merge dialog now has a "Cancel Edit"
button that is displayed when editing the lead record in place. Using
this button will abandon any pending record edits without requiring
that the entire dialog be dismissed.
