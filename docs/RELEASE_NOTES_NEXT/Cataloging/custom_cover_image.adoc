== Custom Cover Image Uploader  ==

If configured for a given Evergreen instance, staff with the UPLOAD_COVER_IMAGE
permission may upload a custom jacket/cover image for a given bibliographic
record for display in the staff client and OPAC. This is done through the Other
Actions -> Upload Cover Image command from the record details page in the staff
interface.

=== Note for system administrators ===

The following stanza needs to be added to eg_vhost.conf:

[source]
----------------------------------------------------------------
<Location /jacket-upload>
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler OpenILS::WWW::Vandelay::spool_jacket
    Options +ExecCGI
    Require all granted
</Location>
----------------------------------------------------------------

and this to the open-ils.vandelay -> app_settings -> databases section of
opensrf.xml:

[source]
----------------------------------------------------------------
<jackets>/openils/var/web/opac/extras/ac</jackets>
----------------------------------------------------------------
with the path appropriately adjusted for your installation. The Apache process
will need write permissions for that directory.
