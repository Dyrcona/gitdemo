== New Action Trigger hook for patron registration ==

Evergreen now includes a new type of Action Trigger hook: stgu.created. This hook will trigger upon the patron registration submission form. In addition to the new hook, an example Action Trigger definition is provided (disabled) entitled "Patron Registered for a card stgu.created". With clever timing and delay settings, a library can receive a single notification containing all of the pending patron registrations for a given time interval. No special server-side considerations required unless you introduce a new granularity. There is, however, a new clause introduced to the "action_trigger_filters.json.example" file.

=== Upgrade instructions ===

Be sure and include this clause in your "action_trigger_filters.json.example" file

"stgu.created" : {
        "context_org": "home_ou",
        "filter": {
            "complete": "f"
        }
    }
