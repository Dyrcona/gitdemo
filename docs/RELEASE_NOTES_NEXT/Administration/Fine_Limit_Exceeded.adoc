New Action Trigger - Fine Limit Exceeded
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
New optional email notification that is sent when a block is applied
to a patron's account due to excess fines.

(The patron block functionality itself already exists and is based on
the settings in Local Admin > Standing Penalties (PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES)
and Local Administration > Group Penalty Thresholds.)
