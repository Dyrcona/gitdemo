Matomo Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Support for the open source web analytics platform Matomo is now 
native to Evergreen. Support is on an org unit level so different 
libraries can have separate or no analytics. Once you setup 
a Matomo service you will need the URL and site ID. Typically 
Matomo will give you a block of javascript you can insert into 
web sites. One line will look like :

var u="http://mylibrary.lib/matomo/";

The full URL in the double quotes will be your URL.  Another line 
will look like:  

_paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);

In this case the number 1 will be your site ID.  

These are set by YOAUSes opac.analytics.matomo_url and 
opac.analytics.matomo_id respectively. There is also a boolean 
setting called opac.analytics.use_matomo which determines if 
it is used at all. Three new permsisions control access to 
these: 

UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.opac.analytics.matomo_id
UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.opac.analytics.matomo_url
UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.opac.analytics.use_matomo
