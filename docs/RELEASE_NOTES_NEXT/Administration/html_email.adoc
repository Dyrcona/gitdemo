== HTML email ==

Administrators can now configure action triggers to send HTML-formatted
email.  Evergreen continues to send emails in plain-text by default, but
you can now configure an email template to send as HTML by adding the appropriate
header to the email.  For example: Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
