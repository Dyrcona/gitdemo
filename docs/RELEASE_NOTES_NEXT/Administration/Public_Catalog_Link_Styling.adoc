Links in Public Catalog Now Have Separate Color
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hyperlinks in the public catalog now have a separate color definition
in the `colors.tt2` template to make it easier to style the public
catalog header/footer to use the same background color as the center
panel.

Upgrade Notes
+++++++++++++
Sites that have customized `colors.tt2` should add a line for
the new `link` color.
