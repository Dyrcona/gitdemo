Install marc_stream_importer.pl By Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The script for the MARC stream importer, `marc_stream_importer.pl`,
is now installed in the Evergreen `bin` directory (typically
`/openils/bin`) by default. It now also expects that its configuration
file will be in the usual config directory (typically `/openils/conf`)
and the example configuration file is installed their by default.

Upgrade Note
++++++++++++
Because `marc_stream_importer.pl` now expects its configuration file to
be in the configuration directory, not the binary directory, existing
users will likely need to manually move the configuration file into
place.
