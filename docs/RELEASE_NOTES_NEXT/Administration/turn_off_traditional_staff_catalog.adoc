== Optionally remove traditional catalog from menu ==

Libraries that have fully migrated to the Angular staff catalog
may optionally hide the "Staff Catalog (Traditional)" menu
options.  To do so, in the Library Settings Editor, set the
"ui.staff.traditional_catalog.enabled" setting to False.

After changing the setting, you will need to log out and log
back in to see the changes to the menu.
