Ability to Reingest Certain Record Attributes In pingest.pl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An option, `--attr`, has been added to the `pingest.pl` support script
that allows the user to specify which record attributes to reingest.
This option is used to specify which record attribute(s) to reingest.
It can be used one or more times to specify one or more attributes to
ingest.  It can be omitted to reingest all record attributes.  This
option is ignored if the `--skip-attrs` option is used.

The `--attr` option is most useful after doing something specific that
requires only a partial ingest of records.  For instance, if you add a
new language to the `config.coded_value_map` table, you will want to
reingest the `item_lang` attribute on all of your records.  The
following command line will do that, and only that, ingest:

----
$ /openils/bin/pingest.pl --skip-browse --skip-search --skip-facets \
    --skip-display --attr=item_lang
----
