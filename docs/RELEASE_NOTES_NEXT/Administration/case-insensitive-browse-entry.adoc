== Case Insensitve Browse Entries ==

It is now possible for a system administrator to select whether
a particular browse entry field's case should be considered when
determining uniqueness.  A new "Browse Folding is Case-Insensitive"
column has been added to the Administration -> Server Administration
-> MARC Search/Facet Fields interface.  Note that a bib record reingest
will be required for changes to take effect.
