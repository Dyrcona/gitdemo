--rebuild-rmsr Option Added to pingest.pl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An option, `--rebuild-rmsr`, has been added to the pingest.pl support
script.  This option will rebuild the
reporter.materialized_simple_record (rmsr) table after the ingests are
complete.

This option might prove useful if you want to rebuild the table as
part of a larger reingest.  If all you wish to do is to rebuild the
rmsr table, then it would be just as simple to connect to the database
server and run the following SQL:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT reporter.refresh_materialized_simple_record();
----
