Aged Billings and Payments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two new database tables are added for tracking aged billings and payments:
money.aged_billing and money.aged_payment.

Two new database views are added, money.all_billings and money.all_payments
for aggregating data across the active and aged tables.

When a circulation is aged, billings and payments linked to the circulation
are migrated from the active billing and payment tables to the new aged 
tables.

The new tables are accessible to the reporter.
