Option to Enable Experimental Angular Staff Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new org unit setting labeled 'GUI: Enable Experimental Angular 
Staff Catalog' (ui.staff.angular_catalog.enabled) has been added, allowing
sites to enable a menu option in the browser client for accessing

Cataloging menu labled "Staff Catalog (Experimental)".
