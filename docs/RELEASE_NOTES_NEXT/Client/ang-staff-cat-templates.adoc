Angular Staff Catalog Recent Searches & Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recent Searches
+++++++++++++++

Adds support for Recent Searches in the Angular staff catalog, consistent
with TPAC staff recent searches.  Setting a value for the library setting
'opac.staff_saved_search.size' is required for the recent searches to appear.

Search Templates
++++++++++++++++

Adds support for named catalog search templates.  Templates allow staff to
create predefined searches (e.g. title =, subject =, format =, etc.) 
where all that's left do to perform the search is fill in the search 
values.

Templates may be built from any of the search tabs -- search, numeric search, 
marc, and browse -- except shelf browse, which uses no filters.

Templates are stored by default as workstation settings, using the setting
key 'eg.catalog.search_templates'.
