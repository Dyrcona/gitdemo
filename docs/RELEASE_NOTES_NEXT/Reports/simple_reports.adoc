== Simple Reports ==

This release includes a new Simple Reports reporting system focused on ease of
use and simplicity that is available from the Administration menu of the
staff client. Simple Reports can be restricted by staff permissions and
access to the overall feature is granted through a new RUN_SIMPLE_REPORTS
permission.

The Simple Reports interface is intended to provide an alternate access point
for running reports in Evergreen and is not intended to replace the main
Reports interface. In particular, users in need of complex reports should
still make use of the main Reports interface.

To simplify report creation some fields are generated from multiple backend
fields and other fields such as dates are repeated with multiple transforms
pre-applied. Reports and schedules can be edited at any time as needed.
