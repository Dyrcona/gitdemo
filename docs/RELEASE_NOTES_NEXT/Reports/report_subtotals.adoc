Reports Subtotals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reports now allow group subtotals and grand totals.  By checking the
new "Calculate grouping subtotals" checkbox under "Output Options",
a new unlabeled row or column is created with the subtotals for each
grouping and an unlabeled grand total row or column.

This takes advantage of PostreSQL's built-in ROLLUP feature.  See the
PostgreSQL documentation for details: 

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS
