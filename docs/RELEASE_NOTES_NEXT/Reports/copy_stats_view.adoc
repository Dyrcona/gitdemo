== Reporter Item Statistics View ==

A new reports source, Item Statistics View is available.
Certain third-party products such as collection development
management providers require copy statistics that are not
readily available in a single report.  This view adds those,
which will also benefit library staff reports generally.

To add the view, a system administrator will need to (re-)run
the example.reporter-extension.sql script, which will create 
the new view in the database.
