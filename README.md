# Git Demonstration Repository #

Demo repository for the Evergreen ILS 2023 pre-conference
presentation: *(Almost) Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Git.*

## Description ##

This repository contains text and sample code branches to be used as
part of the interactive presentation *(Almost) Everything You Always
Wanted to Know About Git* at the
[Evergreen ILS 2023 Conference](https://evergreen-ils.org/conference/2023-evergreen-international-conference/).

You can use this repository to follow along during the presentation, to
experiment with the commands, or to learn and practice Git with the
text and examples provided.

## Getting Started ##

### Prerequisites ###

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), obviously.

An account with [GitHub](https://github.com/) will help, but is not
essential.  If you don't have one, you can [sign up
here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

The command line examples in this demo were performed on GNU/Linux,
specifically Ubuntu 20.04, with git version 2.25.1 but should work in
any environment that offers a command line interface to git.  If you
use a different version of git, some of the command line options may
not work, or there may be different ways of doing some of the steps.

### Installing ###

You can clone this repository directly using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/Dyrcona/gitdemo.git

or, you may [fork this repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
and clone your fork.

## Using This Repository ##

This repository contains text files and code branches that are
intended to work together to teach certain key concepts of using Git.
You should [start here](Start.md) if you are new to Git or want to
begin at the beginning.

This branch, `main`, is intended to serve as the text tutorial.  The
author recommends that you read it on
[GithHub](https://github.com/Dyrcona/gitdemo/tree/main) and work in a
local clone of the repository.

The other branches in this repository are to be used as directed in
the examples and text of the tutorial.  They contain code and other
data that are not directly part of the Git demonstration.  They are
used to illustrate the concepts and provide material for exercises.
Feel free to experiment with these branches as you gain proficiency.
