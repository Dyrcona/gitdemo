# Git Demonstration Repository

Demo repository for the Evergreen ILS 2023 pre-conference
presentation: "(Almost) Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Git."

## Description

TBD: A more detailed description, or just drop it?

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/), obviously.

An account with [GitHub](https://github.com/) will help, but is not
essential.  If you don't have one, you can [signup
here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

The command line examples in this demo are all performed on GNU/Linux,
specifically Ubuntu 20.04, but should work in any environment that
offers a command line interface to git.

### Installing

You can clone this repository directly using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/Dyrcona/gitdemo.git

or, you may [fork this repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
and clone your fork.

## Authors

[Jason Stephenson](https://www.sigio.com/) is responsible for most of
the content here.

## Licenses

TBD: Some kind of CC license for the text and command lists.  Some
code in the example branches are under different licenses.

## Acknowledgments

See the [References](References.md) for more information.
