# Git Demonstration Repository #

Demo repository for the Evergreen ILS 2023 pre-conference
presentation: *(Almost) Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Git.*

## Description ##

This repository contains text and sample code branches to be used as
part of the interactive presentation *(Almost) Everything You Always
Wanted to Know About Git* at the
[Evergreen ILS 2023 Conference](https://evergreen-ils.org/conference/2023-evergreen-international-conference/).

You can use this repository to follow along during the presentation, to
experiment with the commands, or to learn and practice Git with the
text and examples provided.

## Getting Started ##

### Prerequisites ###

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), obviously.

An account with [GitHub](https://github.com/) will help, but is not
essential.  If you don't have one, you can [sign up
here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

The command line examples in this demo were performed on GNU/Linux,
specifically Ubuntu 20.04, with git version 2.25.1 but should work in
any environment that offers a command line interface to git.  If you
use a different version of git, some of the command line options may
not work, or there may be different ways of doing some of the steps.

### Installing ###

You can clone this repository directly using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/Dyrcona/gitdemo.git

or, you may [fork this repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
and clone your fork.
