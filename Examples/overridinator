Usage:
${0##*/} <fromrevision> <overridetag>

Use this program to copy custom Evergreen templates from another
branch into the current branch.

<fromrevision> is another branch or other git revision containing the
modified templates in their original location.

<overridetag> is a string to add to the templates and
templates-bootstrap directory names for the overrides.

Example:
    overridinator rel_3_10-custom _custom

The above will copy the modified templates and bootstrap templates
from Open-ILS/src/templates and Open-ILS/src/templates-bootstrap in
the rel_3_10-custom branch to Open-ILS/src/templates_custom and
Open-ILS/src/templates-bootstrap_custom in the currently checked out
branch.

NB: MARC templates are skipped.  The assumption is that you put these
in the "normal" location and do not override them.
